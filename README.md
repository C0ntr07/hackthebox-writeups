# Submissions

If you want to incorporate your own writeup, notes, scripts or other material to solve the boot2root machines you can do it through a **'pull request'** or by sending us an email to: **hackplayers_at_Ymail.com**. 

In this way, you will be added to our **top contributors list** (see below) and you will also receive an **invitation link to an exclusive Telegram group** where several hints (not spoilers) are discussed for the HacktheBox machines.  

Note: the minimum requirement to enter the "special" Telegram group is also to have a hacker level or higher (no script kiddies).
